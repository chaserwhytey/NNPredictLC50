In this project, my partner and I created a simple neural network containing three hidden layers with the ReLu activation function using TensorFlow in order to predict acute aquatic toxicity in fish. The following 6 features were used:  
CIC0: information indices  
SM1_Dz(Z): 2D matrix-based descriptors  
GATS1i: 2D autocorrelations   
NdsCH: atom-type counts  
NdssC: atom-type counts  
MLOGP: molecular properties  
output:  
LC50: concentration that causes death in 50% of test fish over a test duration of 96 hours.
