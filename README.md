In this project, my partner and I create a simple neural network with three hidden layers and ReLu activation function using TensorFlow in order to predict acute aquatic toxicity in fish through LC50 values using 6 features:
CIC0: information indices  
SM1_Dz(Z): 2D matrix-based descriptors  
GATS1i: 2D autocorrelations  
NdsCH: atom-type counts  
NdssC: atom-type counts  
MLOGP: molecular properties  
The model response, LC50, is the concentration that causes death in 50% of test fish over a test duration of 96 hours.
